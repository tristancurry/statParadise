Sampling from different distributions

Normal:
inverse CDF is not available analytically.
Use rejection sampling if computationally OK - or use polar form of Box-Muller sampling
[s = U^2 + V^2, z1 = u*sqrt((-2ln(s))/s)]

Exponential: p(x) = A*exp(kx)
Normalise over the domain.
inverse CDF is analytic
x = ln[(k/A)*(CDF + B)]/k,  where B = exp(k*E), E is the lower limit of the domain

Linear: p(x) = ax + b, positive over the domain of possible values for x
Normalise over the domain.
CDF is a quadratic that can be inverted with some care...

Uniform:
easy
